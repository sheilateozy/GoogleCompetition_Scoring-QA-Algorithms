# About
Question-answering is a discipline within the field of natural language processing that is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.

This project builds a deep learning model that predicts the quality of automated answers to human-posed questions, taking only text features of the question title, question body, and answer.


# Project Methodology
1. Preprocess text features
2. Create numeric representations for text features using state-of-the-art pre-trained algorithms: GloVe, BERT
3. Model architecture: LSTM with Convolutional layers
4. Model tuning: Increase model regularization
5. Model tuning: Increase model complexity
